Infrared/RF Gateway
-------------------
Service-Type: 0x00000010
Version: 0x00
Description: Sends and receives codes from infrared and RF remote controls.


Calls
-----
* Unload a device protocol (request 0x0001)
  Unload an IR/RF device protocol of any type.
  Body:
    * device id (1 byte): id of the IR/RF protocol (0-254)

* Reset all device protocol (request 0x0002)
  Unload all IR/RF device protocols (of any type).
  Body: <empty>
  
* Send an IR/RF command (request 0x0010)
  Sends an IR/RF command. The protocol must have been loaded first.
  Body:
    * device id (1 byte): id of the IR/RF protocol (0-254)
    * command (8 bytes): IR/RF-device specific command that should be sent


Requests
--------
* Load single-bit fixed-length device protocol (request 0x0001)
  Loads an IR/RF device protocol. This load command supports IR/RF-commands with a fixed length (in bits) and "single-bit" IR/RF sequences.
  Request:
    * device id (1 byte): (device local) id of the IR-device (0-254)
    * unit in us (2 bytes): units used in the rest of the message in microseconds (0-65535)
    * repeats (1 byte): number of time the request is repeated
    * preample length (1 byte): number of pulses in the preample
    * bit length (1 byte): number of pulses for a bit
    * suffix length (1 byte): number of pulses in the suffix. (preample + 2*bit + suffix <= 89)
    * bit count (1 byte): Number of bits in a command (1-64)
    * preample pulse (1 byte)*: [ exactly preample length times ]
    	pulses in units that make up a "zero" bit (0-25%). The "detection" starts with a low state.
    * bit "zero" pulse (1 byte)*: [ exactly bit length times ]
    	pulses in units that make up a "zero" bit
    * bit "one" pulse (1 byte)*: [ exactly bit length times ]
    	pulses in units that make up a "one" bit
    * suffix pulse (1 byte)*: [ exactly suffix length times ]
    	pulses in units that make up the suffix
  Response:
    * device id (1 byte): id of the loaded IR/RF-device
    * result (1 byte): 0x01 for ok, everything else for failed

Subscription
------------
* Subscribe to detected IR/RF commands (0x0001)
  Subscribe to all IR/RF-commands detected by this receiver.
  * Data: <empty>
  * Publish: The receiver has detected an IR/RF command for a device that was previously loaded by a load request.
	  * device-id (1 byte): device id as set by "load device" command
	  * command (8 bytes): IR/RF-device specific command that was received over IR/RF.
