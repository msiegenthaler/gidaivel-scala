Avieuls Protocol
----------------

MESSAGE STRUCTURE:
	* message type (1 byte)
	* message body (max. 99 bytes, length is known to receiver)

Remark: The message is wrapped inside XBee-TX/RX Packets, so the length is known and a checksum is already checked. So we don't need to include that again. Every request message may be sent as a broadcast. The packets also always contain the sender.


MESSAGE TYPES:
	requestInfo (0x01) [in]
		Requests information about the device and its capabilities. The device responds with a announceServices message.
		* (empty)

	announceServices (0x02) [out]
		Sends information about the devices capabilities and services. See the chapter "device services".
		* service 1 (6 bytes): Service provided by the device
		  * service index (1 byte): index of the service in the device.
			* service type (4 bytes): type of the service as described in the chapter "device services"
			* service version (1 byte): version of the service
		* service 2 (6 bytes) [ optional, same structure as  service 1 ]
		* ...				  [ more services, up to 16 total ]

  serviceUnknown (0x10) [in]
    The service requested is unknown to the device. Probably the service index was wrong.
    * service (1 byte): the service-index that was requested, but does not exist
    
  serviceCall (0x20) [in]
    A service-dependent call. The call will not produce a result-message (in contrast to a serviceRequest).
    * service (1 byte): index of the service in the announceServices message
    * request type (2 bytes): type of the request (service dependent).
    * payload (up to 96 bytes): dependent on the service request type

	serviceRequest (0x30) [in]
		A service-dependent request to the device. The request will be answered by the device with a serviceResponse with the same type. Overlapping service requests from the same requestor are not explicitly supported, the answers might be received in an arbitrary order.
		* service (1 byte): index of the service in the announceServices message
		* request type (2 bytes): type of the request (service dependent).
		* payload (up to 96 bytes): dependent on the service request type

	serviceResponse (0x31) [out]
		Response to a serviceRequest. One call always results in exactly one response, either a serviceResponse or a serviceRequestUnknown.
		A service-dependent message from the device to the gateway.
		* service (1 byte): index of the service in the announceServices message
		* request type (2 bytes): type of the request this is the answer to.
		* payload (up to 96 bytes): dependent on the service response type
		
	serviceRequestUnknown (0x3F) [out]
	  The request type is unknown to or unsupported by the device/service.
	  * service (1 byte): index of the service in the announceService message
	  * request type (2 bytes): request type that is unknown or unsupported (see serviceRequest)

	serviceSubscribe (0x40) [in]
		Subscribe to messages a service (see servicePublish). Results in either a service subscriptionConfirm or a serviceSubscriptionUnknown message.
		* service (1 byte): index of the service in the announceServices message
		* subscription type (2 bytes): type of subscription (service dependent).
		* payload (up to 96 bytes): dependent on the service

	serviceUnsubscribe (0x41) [in]
		Unsubscribe from a service (see serviceSubscribe).
		* service (1 byte): index of the service in the announceServices message
		* subscription type (2 bytes): type of subscription  (see serviceSubscribe).
		
	serviceSubscriptionConfirm (0x42) [out]
	  Confirmation of a successful service subscription.
		* service (1 byte): index of the service in the announceServices message
		* subscription type (2 bytes): type of subscription  (see serviceSubscribe).

  serviceSubscriptionUnknown (0x4F) [out]
    The subscription could not be completed because the service does not support this subscription type.
		* service (1 byte): index of the service in the announceServices message
		* subscription type (2 bytes): type of subscription  (see serviceSubscribe).

	servicePublish (0x49) [out]
		Messages to subscribers (see serviceSubscribe).
		A service-dependent message from the device to the gateway.
		* service (1 byte): index of the service in the announceServices message
		* subscription type (2 bytes): type of the subscription (see serviceSubscribe).
