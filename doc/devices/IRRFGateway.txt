IQ-Set:
 * load protocol: Load a new protocol
Message:
 * send command: Send a command to ir/rf
Outgoing Message:
 * command received: A command was received over ir/rf


Generic elements:
  protocol.class = element single-bit-fixed-length {
    attribute name { text },
    element repeats { xsd:integer { minInclusive="1" } },
    element bit-count { xsd:integer { minInclusive="1" } },
    element preample-ns { xsd:long }*,
    element bit-zero-ns { xsd:long }*,
