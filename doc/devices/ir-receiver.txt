Infrared Receiver
-----------------
Service-Type: 0x00000010
Version: 0x00
Description: Receives codes from infrared remote controls.


Calls
-----
<none>

Requests
--------
* Load single-bit fixed-length device profile (request 0x0001)
  Loads an IR device profile. This load command supports IR-commands with a fixed length (in bits) and "single-bit" IR sequences.
  Request:
    * device id (1 byte): (device local) id of the IR-device (0-254)
    * unit in us (2 bytes): units used in the rest of the message in microseconds (0-65535)
    * repeats (1 byte): number of time the request is repeated
    * preample length (1 byte): number of pulses in the preample
    * bit length (1 byte): number of pulses for a bit
    * suffix length (1 byte): number of pulses in the suffix. (preample + 2*bit + suffix <= 89)
    * bit count (1 byte): Number of bits in a command (1-94)
    * preample pulse (1 byte)*: [ exactly preample length times ]
    	pulses in units that make up a "zero" bit (0-25%). The "detection" starts with a low state.
    * bit "zero" pulse (1 byte)*: [ exactly bit length times ]
    	pulses in units that make up a "zero" bit
    * bit "one" pulse (1 byte)*: [ exactly bit length times ]
    	pulses in units that make up a "one" bit
    * suffix pulse (1 byte)*: [ exactly suffix length times ]
    	pulses in units that make up the suffix
  Response:
    * device id (1 byte): id of the loaded IR-device
    * result (1 byte): 0x01 for ok, everything else for failed

* Unload a device profile (request 0x0002)
  Unload an IR device profile of any type.
  Request:
    * device id (1 byte): if of the IR device (0-254)
  Response:
    * device id (1 byte): id of the unloaded IR-device

* Reset all device profiles (request 0x0003)
  Unload all IR device profiles (of any type).
  Request: <empty>
  Response: <empty>

Subscription
------------
* Subscribe to detected IR commands (0x0001)
  Subscribe to all IR-commands detected by this receiver.
  * Data: <empty>
  * Publish: The IR-Receiver has detected an IR command for a device that was previously loaded by a load request.
	  * device-id (1 byte): device id as set by "load device" commands
	  * command (1-95 bytes): IR-device specific command that was received over IR.
